# Active RBI approach in the recommneder system

This repo contains the implementation of the RBI framework for a knowledge based recommender system, such as restaurant recommender. Assuming that the diner has a certain type of restaurant in mind, the system needs to discover the preferred restaurant according to the diner's profile and the responses to the previous queries. Here, we used Entree Chicago Recommendation dataset (Dua et al. 2019).
