New Daq: March 14th 2016

Incorporation of new Daq Module 64. in Windows 7/8- 32/64 and Matlab 32bits.

It has the functionality to load binary files

In order to detect automatically the parallel port you need to replace the old devcon32.exe. I downloaded the Windows Driver Kit (WDK) 8.1  from here:
